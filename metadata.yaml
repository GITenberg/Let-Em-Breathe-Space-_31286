description: Five months out from Earth, we were half-way to Saturn and three-quarters
  of the way to murder. At least, I was. I was sick of the feuding, the worries and
  the pettiness of the other nineteen aboard. My stomach heaved at the bad food, the
  eternal smell of people, and the constant sound of nagging and complaints. For ten
  lead pennies, I'd have gotten out into space and tried walking back to Earth. Sometimes
  I thought about doing it without the pennies.
